# ProArchery
My first android game which was created to simulate real world archery.  This code is quite old and was developed around 2011 by myself.  It is no longer on google play but when it was it had over 250000 downloads.  It was a free game, which displayed adverts at the bottom of the screen.  I never intended to make the source code public but would like to provide it as a sample of my work in order to find new employment and if it is of use to other developer then thats all good too :-)
